# React Native Native Module Linking Error: Uncommon Scenarios

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to native module linking in React Native and provides solutions.  The typical solutions for native module errors (cleaning the project, reinstalling dependencies, etc.) don't always work. This example showcases a more obscure cause.

## Problem
The code attempts to use a native module that's correctly installed but fails to link properly, throwing an error like `'undefined is not an object' (evaluating '_reactNative.NativeModules.MyNativeModule.someMethod')` even after cleaning and reinstalling.

## Solution
The solution may involve verifying the native module's installation on both iOS and Android, ensuring the necessary native code files are included and properly linked in each platform's build process. This includes verifying native build settings and checking for potential conflicts with other dependencies.
