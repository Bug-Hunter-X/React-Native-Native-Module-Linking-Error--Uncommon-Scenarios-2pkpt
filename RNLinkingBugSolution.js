The solution depends on the specific cause of the linking error.  Here are some debugging steps and potential solutions:

**1. Verify Native Module Installation:**
- **Android:** Check your `android/app/build.gradle` and make sure the native module is correctly included as a dependency.
- **iOS:** Ensure the module is added in your `ios/{YourAppName}/Podfile` and that the pods are correctly installed using `pod install`.

**2. Check Native Code Files:**
- Ensure all necessary native files (Java/.h/.m/.mm) are present and in their correct locations within the Android and iOS project directories.

**3. Build System Issues:**
- Try cleaning the project and rebuilding:
    - **Android:** `./gradlew clean`
    - **iOS:** `xcodebuild clean`

**4. Dependency Conflicts:**
- Verify that there are no conflicts between libraries that might interfere with the native module.

**5. Xcode Issues (iOS):**
- Clean the Xcode project (Product > Clean Build Folder).
- Ensure Xcode is up-to-date and any relevant native build settings (Header Search Paths, Library Search Paths) are correctly configured.

**6. React Native Version Compatibility:**
- Check that the native module is compatible with your React Native version.  Try upgrading or downgrading if necessary.

**7. Manual Linking (if necessary):**
- In rare cases, you might need to manually link the native module by adding the necessary code to the appropriate files in your native projects.
